## 1. What is the importance of a Daily stand up?

 - They provide the opportunity for a quick exchange of vital
   information — so teams can share approaches and coordinate next steps.
   
 - They help teams stay agile — quickly adapting to changing
   circumstances and new information so work can progress efficiently.
   
 - They reinforce the self-organizing nature of scrum teams. When you
   are responsible as a team for managing how and when work gets done,
   it is vital to stay in close contact.

### a. Benefits of daily standup meetings

**For such short events, standup meetings can bring major benefits to your team. These can include:**

-   **Improved communication**:  By simply answering the three standard standup questions, teams can develop the habit of conveying need-to-know information quickly and with a mind to group understanding. And daily updates provide the transparency required for effective collaboration. Teams spend less time throughout the week checking on status and trying to pinpoint who is working on what.
    
-   **Increased alignment**: Spending a few minutes together every day can do wonders for team alignment. Standups help everyone stay clear on  [sprint](https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/agile/what-is-a-sprint)  goals, what has been accomplished, and what needs to happen next.
    
-   **Early identification of problems**: The third standup question ("What issues are blocking you?") is all about catching issues early. Roadblocks, bottlenecks, and other problems can be addressed before they become major issues.
    
-   **Enhanced team morale**: Daily standups should leave everyone feeling motivated and ready to tackle the day's challenges. Individual contributors feel connected to the larger team and can see their work in the context of the overall goals and initiatives. Daily standups are also a great opportunity to spotlight individual wins and make sure each team member's contributions are valued.

## 2. What is conveyed by the Burndown Chart?

 - A burndown chart shows the amount of work that has been completed in
   an epic or sprint, and the total work remaining.
   
 - Burndown charts are used to predict your team's likelihood of
   completing their work in the time available.
   
## 3. In case you receive a story in the last day of the sprint to test and you find there are defects, what will you do?

 - Whenever your team finds an incomplete story at the end of the
   Sprint, simply **roll that story, in its entirety, into the next
   Sprint**. When this happens, no points should be awarded to the team,
   for partial completion of the story.

## 4. What does it mean to have a cross functional development team?
*An example would be Ashley's team **where members can fill in for each other** when one of them is on PTO.*

**Some definitions include:**
 - A cross-functional team is a team composed of members from
   different departments in the organization that have diverse skills
   and professional expertise, but are working together to achieve a
   common goal.
   
 - In a cross-functional development team **members have different skill
   sets but are all working towards a common goal**.
